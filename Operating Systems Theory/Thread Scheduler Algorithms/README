To run the code:

1. On Windows, download MSYS2 MinGW 64 (https://www.mysys2.org/)
2. Open a terminal vis MinGW
3. Change your directory to the location you have placed this folder
4. Compile the code with this command (example for First Come First Serve algorithm):
	gcc schedule_fcfs.c -o schedule_fcfs
5. Run the code with this command (same example as line 4):
